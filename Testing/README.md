# Testing

Software testing is the process of executing a program with the intent of finding errors and abnormal or unexpected behavior. Testing and test-driven development (TDD) is a critically important step of the software development process for all Android developers. It helps to reduce defect rates in commercial and enterprise software.

To prepare for the AAD certification exam, Android developers should:

Thoroughly understand the fundamentals of testing
